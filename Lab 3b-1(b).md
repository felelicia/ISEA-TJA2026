## Lab: Bash Backup Scripting, Cron Jobs & Cloud Export (Expanded to 12 Hands-On Activities)
**Objective**
Learn how to automate system backups using Bash scripting and cron, and export backups to a remote cloud server securely.

## Activity 1: Create Test Files and Directory Structure
Objective: Prepare a sample directory for backup.

mkdir -p /home/ubuntu/Documents/testfolder
cd /home/ubuntu/Documents

touch file1 file2 file3 file4 file5
cd testfolder
touch file11 file22 file33 file44 file55
## Activity 2: Write a Basic Bash Script
Objective: Begin your backup script.

nano /home/ubuntu/testscript.sh
Add:

#!/bin/bash
echo "Backup script initiated."
## Activity 3: Use Variables and Date Formatting
Objective: Add timestamped filenames.

now=$(date +"%d_%m_%y")
echo "Today's date is $now"
## Activity 4: Archive Files with cp and zip
Objective: Perform backup of files and compress.

cp -R /home/ubuntu/Documents /home/ubuntu/backup/
zip -r "/home/ubuntu/$now.zip" /home/ubuntu/backup/
## Activity 5: Rename Files Dynamically
Objective: Show use of variables to rename files.

mv /home/ubuntu/backup.zip /home/ubuntu/backup_$now.zip
## Activity 6: Set Permissions and Test Script
Objective: Make script executable and run.

chmod +x /home/ubuntu/testscript.sh
./home/ubuntu/testscript.sh
## Activity 7: Move Script to System Path
Objective: Make your script globally executable.

sudo mv /home/ubuntu/testscript.sh /usr/bin/testscript
sudo chown ubuntu /usr/bin/testscript
Test it by running:

testscript
## Activity 8: Automate with Cron
Objective: Schedule script every hour.

sudo nano /etc/crontab
Add:

0 * * * * ubuntu /usr/bin/testscript
## Activity 9: Use scp to Export to Cloud
Objective: Transfer backups to remote server.

scp -i ~/cloudkey.pem /home/ubuntu/$now.zip ubuntu@remote-ip:/home/ubuntu/
## Activity 10: SSH into Remote Server as Root
Objective: Accept host key so cron can scp.

sudo ssh -i ~/cloudkey.pem ubuntu@remote-ip
Then exit.

## Activity 11: Boot-Time Execution (Challenge)
Objective: Ensure script runs on boot.

sudo crontab -e
Add:

@reboot /usr/bin/testscript
## Activity 12: Customize Terminal Greetings (Challenge)
Objective: Use figlet and neofetch.

sudo apt install figlet neofetch
Edit .bashrc:

echo "figlet Welcome" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "neofetch" >> ~/.bashrc
End of Lab
Test and validate all components. Backup files should be created every hour and securely exported to the cloud server. Confirm cron and boot automation are working.
